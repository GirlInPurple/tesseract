# Tesseract
A Gaming Utility Discord bot written in Python with Nextcord.

## Setup:
First, clone the repo,
Make a file called "config.py" and copy paste this template into it:

```
token = "1234567890"
TGuilds = []
```

- `token` is your bot token, which can be grabbed from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- `TGuilds` are the test servers built into the bot, useful if you only want 1 or 2 servers to have access to a certain debug command.

## Contributing:
If you are on the FinalRepublic Discord server that this bot is for, add whatever you want and submit a PR and we can talk it over there.
For everyone else looking here for whatever reason, feel free to submit a RP or just fork off this project and go your own direction, its MIT lisence for a reason.

## TODO:
- Refrence Sheet command
- Terriara/Calamity Support
- Twitch/YT API
- Overwatch, Apex Leg., and Mojang APIs
